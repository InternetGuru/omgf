# NAME

Oh My Git Flow

# SYNOPSIS

gf [-fciwynvVh] [--color[=WHEN]] [BRANCH|TAG|KEYWORD]

# DESCRIPTION

**Oh My Git Flow** (hereinafter referred as the 'omgf') applies **git flow branching model**(1) on current or selected BRANCH, TAG or KEYWORD (such as 'release' or 'hotfix'). If BRANCH does not exist, new feature is created.

It is an alternative to **git-flow cheatsheet**(2) command with following improvements:

* even simpler usage (no parameters required),

* check and repair project to conform **omgf**,

* automatic **semantic version numbering**(3) (file VERSION),

* version history update support (file CHANGELOG),

* tips how to proceed with development on current state,

* independent production branches support.

# OPTIONS

-c, --conform
: Repair (initialize) project to be conform with **omgf**.

-i, --init
: Same as conform, additionally exit after initialize.

-f, --force
: Move (stash and pop) uncommitted changes.

-w, --what_now
: Display what to do on current branch.

-y, --yes
: Assume yes for all questions.

--color[=WHEN], --colour[=WHEN]
: Use markers to highlight command status; WHEN is 'always', 'never', or 'auto'

-n, --dry-run
: Do not run commands; only parse user options.

-v, --verbose
: Verbose mode.

-V, --version
: Print version number.

-h, --help
: Print help.

# BASIC FLOW EXAMPLES

Set global options
: * ``export GF_OPTIONS="--verbose --what-now"``

Initialize **gf**
: * ``gf --init``

Bugfixing on dev...
: * ``echo "bugfix 1" >> myfile``
* ``git add myfile``
* ``git commit -m "add bugfix 1"``

Create a feature
: * ``gf myfeature``

Developing a feature...
: * ``echo "new feature code 1" >> myfile``
* ``git commit -am "insert myfeature function 1"``
* ``echo "new feature code 2" >> myfile``
* ``git commit -am "insert myfeature function 2"``

Merge feature
: * ``gf``
* Insert myfeature description into CHANGELOG.

Bugfixing on dev...
: * ``echo "bugfix 2" >> myfile``
* ``git commit -am "add bugfix 2"``

Create release
: * ``gf``

Bugfixing on release...
: * ``echo "release bugfix 1" >> myfile``
* ``git commit -am "add release bugfix 1"``
* ``gf`` (only to dev)
* ``echo "release bugfix 2" >> myfile``
* ``git commit -am "add release bugfix 2"``

Merge release
: * ``gf``

Continue with bugfixing on dev...

# ADVANCED EXAMPLES

Hotfix master branch
: * ``gf master``
* ``echo "hotfix 1" >> myfile``
* ``git commit -am "add hotfix 1"``
* ``gf``

Restore git flow model (after pull request to master)
: * ``git checkout dev``
* ``git reset --hard HEAD~1``
* ``gf`` (will result into error 3)
* ``gf -c``

Hotfix previous release
: * ``gf v0.0``
* ``echo "hotfix old" >> myfile``
* ``git add myfile``
* ``git commit -am "add old hotfix"``
* ``gf``

Initialize **gf** on existing project with version number
: * ``echo 1.12.0 > VERSION``
* ``gf --init``

New feature from uncommitted changes
: * ``git checkout dev``
* ``echo "feature x" >> myfile``
* ``gf myfeature`` (will result into error 4)
* ``gf -f myfeature``
* ``git commit -am "add feature x"``

Merge conflicting release
: * ``gf release``
* Exits with standard git merge conflict message.
* Resolve conflicts...
* ``gf``
